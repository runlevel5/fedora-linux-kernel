## What is it?

It is just a clone of the official Fedora Linux kernel.

My Raptor Computing System Blackbird workstation with AMD Radeon R9 Nano is known
to having issue with amdgpu with kernel 5.11 and 5.12. Because the Fedora team decided
to skip 5.10.24 and jump straight to 5.11.7 for Fedora 33. I have no other choices
but to fork the official tree to continue with the 5.10.x

Please check out `f33` branch for details
